\caption{Differences between the Normalised Tree Similarities in terms of clade conservation (Robinson-Foulds distances - RF) and taxa displacement (Triplets - Tr) for the two different inference methods: bayesian or maximum parsimony. Bhatt.coeff is the Bhattacharrya Coefficient (probability of overlap), the statistic and the p.value are from a non-parametric Wilcoxon test (with Bonferonni-Holm correction).}
